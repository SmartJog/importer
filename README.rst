 Importer
=========

The Importer provides a way to call a remote procedure and retrieve its results
in a native format. It has to be used in conjunction with webengine/exporter.

Build and installation
=======================

Bootstrapping
-------------

Importer uses the autotools for its build system.

If you checked out code from the git repository, you will need
autoconf and automake to generate the configure script and Makefiles.

To generate them, simply run::

    $ autoreconf -fvi

Building
--------

Importer builds like your typical autotools-based project::

    $ ./configure && make && make install


Development
===========

We use `semantic versioning <http://semver.org/>`_ for
versioning. When working on a development release, we append ``~dev``
to the current version to distinguish released versions from
development ones. This has the advantage of working well with Debian's
version scheme, where ``~`` is considered smaller than everything (so
version 1.10.0 is more up to date than 1.10.0~dev).
